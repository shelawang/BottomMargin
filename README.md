# sublime-bottom-margin

Sublime Text 3 plugin that gives the editor a bottom margin, keeping some space between your cursor and the bottom of the view.

I made this plugin because I was too lazy to look all the way at the bottom of the window when I was taking notes in Sublime. This plugin shifts the view up as you are typing so that there is always a given amount of space between your cursor and the bottom of the window while you type.

## Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to a directory `sublime-bottom-margin` in the Sublime Text Packages directory.
    * In Sublime Text 3, the Packages directory is called `Data/Packages`.
    * You can find this directory by clicking `Preferences > Browse Packages...` in Sublime.
2. Restart Sublime Text to complete installation.

## Configuration

To manage the settings of this plugin:

1. Open user settings by clicking `Preferences > Settings - User`.
2. Add the `bottom_margin_size` and `bottom_margin_off` options.

### Settings

`bottom_margin_size`

- set to a positive integer to control number of lines in the margin (Example: `"bottom_margin_size" : 5`)
- set to 0 or a negative integer to turn off bottom margin (ie, default Sublime behavior)
- if this setting is not present, default is 3

`bottom_margin_off`

- toggled by the keybinding (see below)
- set to `true` to return to default Sublime behavior
- set to `false` to enable bottom margin
- if this setting is not present, bottom margin is enabled by default


## Key Bindings

The keybinding `alt+shift+m` will toggle the bottom margin on and off. This sequence can be changed in the file `sublime-bottom-margin/Default (Windows).sublime-keymap`.

## Coming Soon

- Screenshots
- Installation using Package Control
- Plugin-specific settings file
- Toggling on/off using the Sublime Command Palette
- Typewriter mode: set the bottom margin to be half of the window size
- Focus mode: dim all but several lines around the current line (if possible)
